To build locally you need to have `fabricate` installed. Then you can use `fab
devel` and preview the site in browser. When all is ready, if you have rights
you can do a `fab deploy` to update the contents to the serving machine.

To build locally without having `fabricate` you can use `jekyll` and preview
each HTML page separately or `jekyll --server` to have a dummy server set up
for serving the entire site (default is localhost, port 4000).
