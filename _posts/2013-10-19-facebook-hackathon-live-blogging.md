Alex: Ladies and gentleman, fast hackers and coder perfectionists, web developers and mobile app creators, we present you the first edition of the Facebook hackathon in Romania. Organized by your favorite open-source community ROSEdu, the volunteers have been busy all morning preparing the workspace for the 15 participating teams. We have pizza, beer and a mountain of bean bags for people who _move fast and break things_.

Alex: At 3:30 PM, people have started their IDEs (or text editors for more hardcore people) and started installing their gems (Ruby guy here sorry). After a quick intro from the organizers about the rules, the Facebook engineers presented their skills and their expectations: it's fun to code, but it's awesome **to ship**. So happy shipping hackers!
