#### 3:30PM

Ladies and gentleman, fast hackers and coder perfectionists, web developers and
mobile app creators, we present you the first edition of the Facebook hackathon
in Romania. Organized by your favorite open-source community ROSEdu, the
volunteers have been busy all morning preparing the workspace for the 15
participating teams. We have pizza, beer and a mountain of bean bags for people
who _move fast and break things_.

#### 3:30PM

People have started their IDEs (or text editors for more hardcore people) and
started installing their gems (Ruby guy here sorry). After a quick intro from
the organizers about the rules, the Facebook engineers presented their skills
and their expectations: it's fun to code, but it's awesome **to ship**. So happy
shipping hackers!

#### 5:30PM

A brief pause and all the keyboard presses have stopped. The Facebook
representatives have given out a random prize! One Facebook T-shirt.
Congratulations to Andrei Duma! People are now back to coding and making their
ideas come to life: **done is better than perfect**.

#### First team

Only 4 hours in the event! We have interviewed some of the participants and
they're coding, designing and implementing their application basis! The first
team we interviewed is [3_awesome_guys_and_a_llama](https://github.com/rosedu/3_awesome_guyes_and_a_llama).
These students from the University "Politehnica" of Bucharest are writing an
Event Planner. From what they told us, it's an application which tries to help
people organize events for them and their friends for their night out. It's more
focused on location, than being focused on time, so they can make it a planned
drink-up or dance-off. They integrate it with the Facebook Places API and would
like to have bars, clubs and restaurants use their app so people can make
reservations. As technology stack, they have Python on top of Google App Engine.
One of the devs said that he learned about it on a [Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs253)
which I recommend it to you. They also plan to use Twitter's Bootstrap library
because they do not have enough frontend experience.

#### Be green, recycle

You are a human, walking down and you see a big pile of garbage. It's a scenario
common here in Romania. But what if you have an app for cleaning it? That's what
[sudoRecycle](https://github.com/rosedu/sudoRecycle) is trying to do with their
Android idea. You see the junk, take a photo, tag it with the GPS location and
send it to their servers. Using their backend written in PHP, they will send
teams of robots that will clean the area. Because we human beings are really
lazy, they plan to use the Facebook API for gamification, so you could level up
in cleaning the world.

#### Explore the underground

We've all endured the lack of knowledge of moving around Bucharest, if we haven't
lived here. But [dark_side_of_the_moon](https://github.com/rosedu/Dark_side_of_the_moon)
is going to remedy this with their offline mobile subway connection app. You
want to get from X to Y using the shortest route. It also wants to tell you what
ground-level public transportation is there and what you can visit. Furthermore
they want it to tell your friends where you've been after you used its
functionality to check-in at your destination. Under the hood, it's using
Android 4.0+ API and they want to integrate with the Facebook API to see the
places your friends have visited. The coolest feature they want to code will
tell you when the next tube will arrive.

#### GRails

Did you know that in the year 2013, if you apply to MIT, you must send the papers
by fax or postal mail? And after you send them, a person will manually go
through them and tell you that the papers have arrived? Or if you get into a
university you must write 6 papers with about 60% redundant information? That's
what [GRails](https://github.com/rosedu/GRails), the only team made entirely of
girls, is trying to solve, fighting bureaucracy with Rails 4. Now with 100% less
paper involved!

#### Hiking

Everybody knows that Romania has some of the best hiking routes, beautiful views
and mysterious mountains. And who doesn't want to know what trips you can make
in the wild nature? Well, you can now check out a map and see what is available
for adventurers! The map also shows you elevation, so you know if it's a long
road and also an abrupt road. A Django platform by [saltaretii](https://github.com/rosedu/saltaretii)
should be enough to support this paradise for nature's explorers!
