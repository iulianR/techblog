_Alex_ - Ladies and gentleman, fast hackers and coder perfectionists, web developers and mobile app creators, we present you the first edition of the Facebook hackathon in Romania. Organized by your favorite open-source community ROSEdu, the volunteers have been busy all morning preparing the workspace for the 15 participating teams. We have pizza, beer and a mountain of bean bags for people who _move fast and break things_.

_Alex_ - At 3:30 PM, people have started their IDEs (or text editors for more hardcore people) and started installing their gems (Ruby guy here sorry). After a quick intro from the organizers about the rules, the Facebook engineers presented their skills and their expectations: it's fun to code, but it's awesome **to ship**. So happy shipping hackers!

_Marius_ - At 5:30 PM, a brief pause and all the keyboard presses have stopped. The Facebook representatives have given out a random prize! One Facebook T-shirt. Congratulations to Andrei Duma! People are now back to coding and making their ideas come to life: **done is better than perfect**.

_Marius_ - 19:00, only 4 hours in the event! We have interviewed some of the participants and they're coding, designing and implementing their application basis! The first team we interviewed is 3_awesome_guys_and_a_llama. These students from the Polytechnic University of Bucharest are writing an Event Planner. From what they told us, it's an application which tries to help people organize events for them and their friends for their night out. It's more focused on location, than being focused on time, so they can make it a planned drink-up or dance-off. They integrate it with the Facebook API and would like to have bars, clubs and restaurants use their app so people can make reservations.
