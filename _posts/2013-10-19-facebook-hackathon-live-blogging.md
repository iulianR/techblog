#### 3:30PM

Ladies and gentleman, fast hackers and coder perfectionists, web developers and mobile app creators, we present you the first edition of the Facebook hackathon in Romania. Organized by your favorite open-source community ROSEdu, the volunteers have been busy all morning preparing the workspace for the 15 participating teams. We have pizza, beer and a mountain of bean bags for people who _move fast and break things_.

#### 3:30PM

People have started their IDEs (or text editors for more hardcore people) and started installing their gems (Ruby guy here sorry). After a quick intro from the organizers about the rules, the Facebook engineers presented their skills and their expectations: it's fun to code, but it's awesome **to ship**. So happy shipping hackers!

#### 5:30PM

A brief pause and all the keyboard presses have stopped. The Facebook representatives have given out a random prize! One Facebook T-shirt. Congratulations to Andrei Duma! People are now back to coding and making their ideas come to life: **done is better than perfect**.

#### First team

Only 4 hours in the event! We have interviewed some of the participants and they're coding, designing and implementing their application basis! The first team we interviewed is [3_awesome_guys_and_a_llama](https://github.com/rosedu/3_awesome_guyes_and_a_llama). These students from the University "Politehnica" of Bucharest are writing an Event Planner. From what they told us, it's an application which tries to help people organize events for them and their friends for their night out. It's more focused on location, than being focused on time, so they can make it a planned drink-up or dance-off. They integrate it with the Facebook Places API and would like to have bars, clubs and restaurants use their app so people can make reservations. As technology stack, they have Python on top of Google App Engine. One of the devs said that he learned about it on a [Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs253) which I recommend it to you. They also plan to use Twitter's Bootstrap library because they do not have enough frontend experience.

#### Be green, recycle

You are a human, walking down and you see a big pile of garbage. It's a scenario common here in Romania. But what if you have an app for cleaning it? That's what [sudoRecycle](https://github.com/rosedu/sudoRecycle) is trying to do with their Android idea. You see the junk, take a photo, tag it with the GPS location and send it to their servers. Using their backend written in PHP, they will send teams of robots that will clean the area. Because we human beings are really lazy, they plan to use the Facebook API for gamification, so you could level up in cleaning the world.

#### Explore the underground

We've all endured the lack of knowledge of moving around Bucharest, if we haven't lived here. But [dark_side_of_the_moon](https://github.co/rosedu/Dark_side_of_the_moon) is going to remedy this with their offline mobile subway connection app. You want to get from X to Y using the shortest route. It also wants to tell you what ground-level public transportation is there and what you can visit. Furthermore they want it to tell your friends where you've been after you used its functionality to check-in at your destination. Under the hood, it's using Android 4.0+ API and Java technology.
